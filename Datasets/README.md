We provide both the raw datasets and our encoded datasets. Encoded datasets are denoted by _enc at the end of the filename. Numerical
datasets include a description of their encoding in the filename.  The encoded datasets can be regenerated by running 
load_instance with force_encoding=True. 

The `AuxFiles/` directory contains auxiliary information associated with each dataset and EQP sets which
have been stored to save computation
